# Evolution of institutional concentration in AI research

## Hypothesis

The arrival of large language models and other AI techniques that require large amounts of data and compute is linked to growing institutional concentration in AI research and increasing leadership by private sector labs with the resources to advance and deploy those techniques. Smaller organisations and institutions including the bulk of academic researchers are increasingly operating as users and evaluators of the techniques developed by the private sector, with limited ability to influence the trajectory of AI.

## Policy relevance

Increasing institutional concentration in AI research reduces the number of perspectives informing AI development, which could 

* Lead to focus on a small number of applications with narrow benefits
* Reduce the scope for critical collective assessment of dominant technologies in order to identify their risks and limitations
* Reduce the number of ideas that are explored and recombined creatively
* Centralise advanced R\&D capabilities and absorptive capacity, cementing the dominant position of currently leading institutions

## Measurement

* We measure institutional concentration with entropy / herfindahl / gini indices of concentration of research activity.
* If our hypothesis is valid, we should see:
    * Increasing levels of concentration over time
    * A jump in concentration around the time that LLMs arrive in the scene in the late 2010s
    * More concentration in more influential tiers of research (consistent with the idea that more influential i.e. more highly cited research is more likely to be foundational and advance the state of the art).
    * More concentration and faster increases in concentration in areas of AI research where LLMs have become more widely adopted and impactful
        * We could identify these areas ex ante e.g. language earlier than computer vision or by clustering AI research thematically and identifying those areas that generate more citations to foundational LLM research e.g. the attention paper.
* All the above should be associated to an increase in prominance of private companies
* Is this a Western dynamic? What happens when we exclude Chinese institutions / companies?
